  /*
    A Database Trigger will always call a function with a changeEvent.
    Documentation on ChangeEvents: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/change-events/

    Access the _id of the changed document:
    var docId = changeEvent.documentKey._id;

    Access the latest version of the changed document (with Full Document enabled for Insert, Update, and Replace operations):
    var fullDocument = changeEvent.fullDocument;

    var updateDescription = changeEvent.updateDescription;

    See which fields were changed (if any):
    if (updateDescription) {
      var updatedFields = updateDescription.updatedFields; // A document containing updated fields
    }

    See which fields were removed (if any):
    if (updateDescription) {
      var removedFields = updateDescription.removedFields; // An array of removed fields
    }

    Functions run by Triggers are run as System users and have full access to Services, Functions, and MongoDB Data.

    Accessing a mongodb service:
    var collection = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("db_name").collection("coll_name");
    var doc = collection.findOne({ name: "mongodb" });

    To call other named functions:
    var result = context.functions.execute("function_name", arg1, arg2);
  */
};
